## NOTICE
- If you want to access files that are in external storage (like download, picture). you need to add follow manifest in Android 11 ([detail](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/manage-all-files?hl=en)).
```.xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

- This plugin supports both Vulkan and OpenGLES, but if you are building an application that uses a Vulkan graphics API, the Android device must support OpenGLES as well as Vulkan. This is because some processes in this plugin depend on the GLES API.

- Now supports play in VR ([link](https://github.com/TLabAltoh/TLabWebViewVR)).

## TODO
- Remove the GLES API dependency from the Vulkan use case.
